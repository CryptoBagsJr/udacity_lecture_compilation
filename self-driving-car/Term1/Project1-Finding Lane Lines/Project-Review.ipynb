    "- To center even more your annotations on the actual lane lines, I recommend you try tuning the values of your parameters especially the ```threshold``` , ```min_line_length``` and ```max_line_gap```.\n",
    "- Examine the parameters by modifying them separately. That will allow you to identify how each parameter affects the lane line. For example:\n",
    "    - ```max_line_gap``` defines the maximum distance between segments that will be connected to a single line.\n",
    "    - ```min_line_len``` defines the minimum length of a line that will be created.\n",
    "- Increasing these parameters will create smoother and longer lines\n",
    "    - ```threshold``` defines the minimum number of intersections in a given grid cell that are required to choose a line.\n",
    "- Increasing this parameter, the filter will choose longer lines and ignore short lines.\n",
    "- These resources ( 1 & 2 & 3 ) might provide further intuition on the subject here"
